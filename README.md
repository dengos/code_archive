============


This code archive is major in c++. There will be some basic algorithm code, feel free to check out if you like.

1. trie  
A simple version of data structure trie.
If you interset in trie, follow the link below:   
http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=usingTries  
For more about trie and hash, the wikipedia link below is good for start:   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie  

2. binary indexed tree
A binary indexed tree(BIT) struct implementation based on std::vector.  
The goodie about BIT, is that it only take O(N) complexity for constructing, which cost O(N) memory too. The update and query operation can be done in O(logN) time.  
More specifically, my bit code is based on top-coder algorithm tutorials.

3. union find
Union find is super powerfull for set query.
