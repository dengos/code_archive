code_archive
============


This code archive is major in c++. There will be some basic algorithm code, feel free to check out if you like.

1. trie  
A simple version of data structure trie.

2. binary indexed tree
A binary indexed tree struct implementation based on std::vector.  "<O(N), O(logN)>"
More specifically, my bit code is based on top-coder algorithm tutorials.
